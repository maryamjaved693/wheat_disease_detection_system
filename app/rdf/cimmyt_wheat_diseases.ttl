Importance: Bacterial spike blight is not economically important. Viral Diseases Viruses are the smallest pathogens presented irl this field guide, and only one viral disease (BYD) is discussed. The infectious viral particle is called a virion, which is a stable, non-multiplying stage by which the virus is transferred from one plant to another. Viruses multiply in the host plant, and transmission may occur via several means: by insects and mites (especially sucking insects, such as aphids), by nematodes, by seed, by pollen, by fungi, by soil and mechanically. Viral diseases are often difficult to detect because infected hosts may not display visible symptoms, or symptoms may closely resemble those of various physiological disorders or genetic abnormalities. Identification can be facilitated by determining which vectors are present and the host range; in many cases, positive identification requires the use of an electron microscope and serological techniques." ;

    rdfs:label "This fungus causes rotting of the roots and lower stems. Basal stem and leaf sheath tissues, as well as roots, may turn a shiny black color (37). When examined with a hand lens (10x1, dark fungal hyphae may often be found on the subcrown internode beneath the old leaf sheaths. Coarse, black runner hyphae are conspicuous on roots. Severe disease development is indicated by stunted plants with whitened stems and spikes (38, page 43). When infection occurs early in the crop cycle, the number of tillers is often reduced and spikes are often sterile." .

    rdfs:label "Initial infections come from diseased crop debris in the soil, or from diseased grass hosts. Usually the lower leaves are infected first, and the disease progresses to the upper leaves and leaf sheaths if conditions are favorable. This disease develops over a wide range of temperatures and is favored by long periods (1 8 hours or more) of dew or rain." .

    rdfs:label "At first, lesions appear as tan to brown flecks, which expand into large, irregular, oval- or lens-shaped tan blotches with a yellow or chlorotic margin (23). As these spots coalesce, large blotches are formed. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center of the lesion is characteristic of the disease. As the disease progresses, entire leaves, spikes, and even whole plants may be killed." .
